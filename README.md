## Assignment Instructions

First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

## Review Criteria

The application must include the following:

* Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
* Some operation on the ui input in server.R
* Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
* You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
* The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

## App introduction
The app gives the user an overview of the chances of Old Faithful erupting. The user can choose an amount of days in the slider, and the app then shows the amount of times that Old Faithful has erupted after the amount of specified days, in the past.

The app can be found at https://evar.shinyapps.io/OldFaithful/
